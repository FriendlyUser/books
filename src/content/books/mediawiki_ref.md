## 1.7 Navigating and understanding MediaWiki namespaces


MediaWiki namespaces are a way of grouping pages together on a wiki. They are used to distinguish between different types of pages, such as articles, discussions, and templates.

Namespaces are prefixed to the name of a page, separated by a colon. For example, the page "Help:Contents" is in the "Help" namespace.

There are a number of built-in namespaces in MediaWiki, including:

* **Main:** This is the default namespace for articles.
* **Talk:** This namespace is for discussions about articles.
* **User:** This namespace is for user profiles.
* **User_talk:** This namespace is for discussions about user profiles.
* **Project:** This namespace is for pages about projects.
* **Project_talk:** This namespace is for discussions about projects.
* **File:** This namespace is for images and other files.
* **File_talk:** This namespace is for discussions about images and other files.

You can also create your own namespaces. To do this, you need to edit the `LocalSettings. file and add a new line to the `$wgNamespaces` array. For example, to create a namespace called "MyNamespace", you would add the following line to the `LocalSettings. file:

```
$wgNamespaces['MyNamespace'] = 'MyNamespace';
```

Once you have created a namespace, you can use it to create pages. For example, to create a page called "MyNamespace:HelloWorld", you would use the following URL:

```
http://example.com/wiki/MyNamespace:HelloWorld
```

Namespaces can be used to organize your wiki and to make it easier for users to find the information they are looking for. If you are creating a wiki, I recommend using namespaces to organize your pages.

Here are some additional tips for using namespaces:

* Use namespaces to distinguish between different types of pages. For example, you could use a namespace for articles, a namespace for discussions, and a namespace for templates.
* Use namespaces to organize your pages by topic. For example, you could create a namespace for pages about animals, a namespace for pages about plants, and a namespace for pages about people.
* Use namespaces to make it easier for users to find the information they are looking for. For example, if you have a large wiki, you could create a namespace for each of your major sections. This would make it easier for users to find the pages they are looking for.

Namespaces are a powerful tool that can be used to organize your wiki and to make it easier for users to find the information they are looking for. If you are creating a wiki, I recommend using namespaces to organize your pages.

## 1.9 Managing user permissions and access control in MediaWiki


MediaWiki has a robust user permissions system that allows you to control who has access to your wiki and what they can do.

There are two main types of permissions in MediaWiki: **global permissions** and **page-specific permissions**.

Global permissions control what users can do on your wiki as a whole. For example, you can use global permissions to control whether users can create new pages, edit existing pages, or delete pages.

Page-specific permissions control what users can do with specific pages. For example, you can use page-specific permissions to control whether users can view a page, edit a page, or delete a page.

To manage user permissions in MediaWiki, you need to edit the `LocalSettings. file. This file is located in the root directory of your MediaWiki installation.

The `LocalSettings. file is a PHP file, so you will need to have some knowledge of PHP to edit it. If you are not familiar with PHP, you can find a number of tutorials online that can help you learn how to edit PHP files.

Here are some of the things you can do in the `LocalSettings. file:

* **Set global permissions:** You can set global permissions by editing the `$wgGroupPermissions` array. This array contains a list of all the groups in your wiki and the permissions that each group has.
* **Set page-specific permissions:** You can set page-specific permissions by editing the `$wgPagePermissions` array. This array contains a list of all the pages in your wiki and the permissions that each user has for each page.

If you are not sure what to do in the `LocalSettings. file, you can always consult the MediaWiki documentation. The documentation is available online and can be found at https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Configuration.

Managing user permissions in MediaWiki can be a bit daunting at first, but it is a rewarding experience. By taking the time to manage user permissions, you can create a wiki that is secure and that meets the needs of your users.

Here are some additional tips for managing user permissions in MediaWiki:

* **Use a role-based permission system:** A role-based permission system allows you to assign permissions to groups of users. This can make it easier to manage permissions and to ensure that users only have the permissions they need.
* **Use the MediaWiki API:** The MediaWiki API can be used to programmatically manage user permissions. This can be useful if you need to manage permissions for a large number of users or if you need to automate the management of permissions.
* **Use a permission checker:** A permission checker is a tool that can be used to verify that users have the permissions they need to access a page or to perform an action. This can be useful to ensure that your wiki is secure and that users cannot access pages or perform actions that they are not authorized to do.

Managing user permissions is an important part of securing your wiki. By taking the time to manage user permissions, you can create a wiki that is secure and that meets the needs of your users.

* **Categories** are a way of grouping related pages together. For example, you could create a category for all of your pages about animals, or a category for all of your pages about the city of London.
* **Templates** are a way of inserting pre-formatted content into a page. For example, you could create a template for a page that lists all of the books in a series, or a template for a page that shows a map of a city.

Both categories and templates can be used to make your wiki easier to use and navigate. For example, if you have a large number of pages about animals, you could create a category for each type of animal. This would make it easy for users to find pages about the animals that they are interested in.

You can also use categories and templates to create a consistent look and feel for your wiki. For example, you could create a template that includes a header, a footer, and a list of links to other pages. This would make all of your pages look similar, which would make your wiki more professional and polished.

To use categories and templates, you will need to know how to add them to your pages. You can add categories to a page by clicking on the "Categories" tab and then entering the names of the categories that you want to add. You can add templates to a page by clicking on the "Templates" tab and then entering the name of the template that you want to use.

Once you have added categories and templates to your pages, you can use them to organize and structure your content. For example, you could create a page that lists all of the pages in a category. You could also create a page that shows all of the templates that are available on your wiki.

Categories and templates are powerful tools that can be used to make your wiki easier to use and navigate. By using them effectively, you can create a wiki that is both informative and visually appealing.

Here are some additional tips for using categories and templates:

* Use descriptive names for your categories and templates. This will make it easier for users to find the content that they are looking for.

## 1.14 Collaborating and managing changes with MediaWiki's version control


MediaWiki's version control system allows multiple users to collaborate on the same wiki without fear of overwriting each other's changes. When a user makes a change to a page, the change is saved as a new revision. Each revision is stored in the MediaWiki database, and users can view and restore previous revisions of a page.

To collaborate on a wiki, users must first create an account. Once they have created an account, they can log in and start editing pages. When a user makes a change to a page, the change is saved as a new revision. Other users can then view the new revision and decide whether or not to merge it into their own copy of the page.

If a user does not want to merge a revision, they can restore the previous revision of the page. To do this, they can click on the "History" tab and then select the revision that they want to restore.

MediaWiki's version control system is a powerful tool that allows multiple users to collaborate on the same wiki without fear of overwriting each other's changes. By using version control, users can ensure that their changes are always safe and that they can always revert to a previous revision if necessary.

Here are some tips for collaborating and managing changes with MediaWiki's version control:

* **Use descriptive revision names**. This will make it easier for other users to understand what changes you have made.

## 2.8 Working with tabs and namespaces in MediaWiki


MediaWiki tabs and namespaces are two features that can be used to organize pages in a wiki. Tabs allow you to create multiple views of the same page, while namespaces allow you to create separate collections of pages.

**Tabs**

Tabs can be used to create multiple views of the same page. For example, you could create a tab for the main content of the page, a tab for the discussion of the page, and a tab for the history of the page.

To create a tab, you need to add a `<tab>` tag to the page. The `<tab>` tag has two attributes: `title` and `content`. The `title` attribute specifies the title of the tab, and the `content` attribute specifies the content of the tab.

For example, the following code would create a tab with the title "Main Content" and the content of the main content of the page:

```
<tab title="Main Content">
  {{main}}
</tab>
```

**Namespaces**

Namespaces allow you to create separate collections of pages. For example, you could create a namespace for pages about animals, a namespace for pages about plants, and a namespace for pages about people.

To create a namespace, you need to add a `<namespace>` tag to the page. The `<namespace>` tag has one attribute: `name`. The `name` attribute specifies the name of the namespace.

For example, the following code would create a namespace with the name "Animals":

```
<namespace name="Animals">
</namespace>
```

Once you have created a namespace, you can add pages to the namespace by prefixing the page name with the namespace name. For example, the following code would add a page named "Dog" to the "Animals" namespace:

```
<page name="Animals:Dog">
  {{content}}
</page>
```

Tabs and namespaces can be used together to create a more organized and user-friendly wiki. For example, you could create a tab for each namespace, and then use the tabs to navigate to different collections of pages.

Here are some tips for working with tabs and namespaces in MediaWiki:

* **Use tabs to create multiple views of the same page**. This can be helpful for pages that have a lot of content, or for pages that you want to organize into different sections.
* **Use namespaces to create separate collections of pages**. This can be helpful for pages that are about different topics, or for pages that you want to keep separate for security or privacy reasons.
* **Use both tabs and namespaces to create a more organized and user-friendly wiki**. This can make it easier for users to find the information that they are looking for.

## 2.9 Managing your watchlist and tracking changes
