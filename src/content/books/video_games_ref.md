This means playing the game as intended, using the skills and resources available to you, and working within the rules of the game to gain an advantage over your opponents.

If you do encounter what appears to be a weakness in the game, consider reporting it to the game developers rather than exploiting it. This will help maintain the overall game balance and ensure that everyone has a fair and enjoyable experience.

It's important to take frequent breaks, ideally every 30 minutes to an hour, to give your eyes and body a rest. Use this time to stretch, move around, and refocus your eyes on something other than a screen. Taking a short walk or doing some light exercise can help improve blood flow and energy levels.

Additionally, getting enough sleep is essential for optimal gameplay. Aim for at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night to ensure your body and mind are well-rested and ready to perform at their best. Proper nutrition and hydration are also important, so be sure to eat a balanced diet and drink plenty of water throughout the day.
