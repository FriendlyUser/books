<h2 id="11-what-is-mediawiki">1.1 What is MediaWiki?</h2>
<p>MediaWiki is a free and open-source wiki software application that is used to create and manage wikis. Wikis are websites that allow users to collaboratively create and edit content. MediaWiki is used by a wide variety of organizations, including Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, and the United Nations.</p>
<p>MediaWiki is written in the PHP programming language and stores all text content into a database. The software is optimized to efficiently handle large projects, which can have terabytes of content and hundreds of thousands of views per second. Because Wikipedia is one of the world’s largest websites, achieving scalability through multiple layers of caching and database replication has been a major concern for developers.</p>
<p>MediaWiki is a powerful and flexible platform that can be used to create a wide variety of wikis. Some of the features of MediaWiki include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collaborative editing: Multiple users can edit the same page at the same time.</li>
<li>Version control: All changes to pages are tracked, so you can easily revert to a previous version.</li>
<li>Media support: MediaWiki can be used to store and display a wide variety of media, including images, videos, and audio files.</li>

<h2 id="12-history-and-significance-of-mediawiki">1.2 History and significance of MediaWiki</h2>
<p>MediaWiki was first developed in 2001 by Magnus Manske, a student at the University of Münster in Germany. Manske was inspired to create MediaWiki after using the UseModWiki software to create a wiki for his university’s computer science department. UseModWiki was a popular wiki software application at the time, but it was not designed to handle the large number of users and pages that Wikipedia was attracting.</p>
<p>MediaWiki was designed to address the scalability and performance issues of UseModWiki. It was also designed to be more user-friendly and to provide a wider range of features. MediaWiki quickly became the software of choice for Wikipedia, and it is now used by a wide variety of other wikis, including the Wikimedia Foundation’s other projects, such as Wiktionary, Wikibooks, and Wikinews.</p>
<p>MediaWiki is a significant piece of software because it has made it possible for anyone to create and edit a wiki. This has led to the creation of a wide variety of wikis, including wikis for businesses, schools, and communities. MediaWiki has also made it possible for people to collaborate on projects on a global scale.</p>
<p>Here are some of the reasons why MediaWiki is so significant:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is free and open-source software, which means that anyone can use it and modify it.</li>
<li>It is scalable and can handle large amounts of traffic.</li>
<li>It is easy to use and learn.</li>
<li>It has a wide range of features, including version control, media support, and extensions.</li>
</ul>
<p>MediaWiki is a powerful and flexible platform that can be used to create a wide variety of wikis. If you are looking for a way to collaborate with others or to create a knowledge base, MediaWiki is a great option.</p>

<h2 id="16-exploring-the-mediawiki-user-interface">1.6 Exploring the MediaWiki user interface</h2>
<p>The MediaWiki user interface is divided into two main parts: the <strong>toolbar</strong> and the <strong>content area</strong>.</p>
<p>The toolbar contains a number of buttons that you can use to create and edit pages, as well as to perform other tasks, such as searching and viewing the history of a page.</p>
<p>The content area is where you will enter the text of your pages. You can use a variety of formatting options to make your text look the way you want it to.</p>
<p>Here are some of the buttons in the toolbar:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New page:</strong> This button allows you to create a new page.</li>
<li><strong>Edit:</strong> This button allows you to edit an existing page.</li>
<li><strong>Preview:</strong> This button allows you to preview the changes you have made to a page.</li>
<li><strong>Save:</strong> This button saves the changes you have made to a page.</li>
<li><strong>History:</strong> This button shows you the history of changes that have been made to a page.</li>
<li><strong>Search:</strong> This button allows you to search for pages on the wiki.</li>
<li><strong>Logout:</strong> This button logs you out of the wiki.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some of the formatting options you can use in the content area:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bold:</strong> This formatting option makes text bold.</li>

<h2 id="17-navigating-and-understanding-mediawiki-namespaces">1.7 Navigating and understanding MediaWiki namespaces</h2>
<p>MediaWiki namespaces are a way of grouping pages together on a wiki. They are used to distinguish between different types of pages, such as articles, discussions, and templates.</p>
<p>Namespaces are prefixed to the name of a page, separated by a colon. For example, the page “Help:Contents” is in the “Help” namespace.</p>
<p>There are a number of built-in namespaces in MediaWiki, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Main:</strong> This is the default namespace for articles.</li>
<li><strong>Talk:</strong> This namespace is for discussions about articles.</li>
<li><strong>User:</strong> This namespace is for user profiles.</li>
<li><strong>User_talk:</strong> This namespace is for discussions about user profiles.</li>
<li><strong>Project:</strong> This namespace is for pages about projects.</li>
<li><strong>Project_talk:</strong> This namespace is for discussions about projects.</li>
<li><strong>File:</strong> This namespace is for images and other files.</li>
<li><strong>File_talk:</strong> This namespace is for discussions about images and other files.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also create your own namespaces. To do this, you need to edit the <code>LocalSettings. file and add a new line to the </code>$wgNamespaces<code>array. For example, to create a namespace called "MyNamespace", you would add the following line to the</code>LocalSettings. file:</p>

<h2 id="28-working-with-tabs-and-namespaces-in-mediawiki">2.8 Working with tabs and namespaces in MediaWiki</h2>
<p>MediaWiki tabs and namespaces are two features that can be used to organize pages in a wiki. Tabs allow you to create multiple views of the same page, while namespaces allow you to create separate collections of pages.</p>
<p><strong>Tabs</strong></p>
<p>Tabs can be used to create multiple views of the same page. For example, you could create a tab for the main content of the page, a tab for the discussion of the page, and a tab for the history of the page.</p>
<p>To create a tab, you need to add a <code>&#x3C;tab></code> tag to the page. The <code>&#x3C;tab></code> tag has two attributes: <code>title</code> and <code>content</code>. The <code>title</code> attribute specifies the title of the tab, and the <code>content</code> attribute specifies the content of the tab.</p>
<p>For example, the following code would create a tab with the title “Main Content” and the content of the main content of the page:</p>
<pre is:raw="" class="astro-code one-dark-pro" style="background-color: #282c34; overflow-x: auto; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="color: #abb2bf">&#x3C;tab title="Main Content"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #abb2bf">  {{main}}</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #abb2bf">&#x3C;/tab></span></span></code></pre>
<p><strong>Namespaces</strong></p>
<p>Namespaces allow you to create separate collections of pages. For example, you could create a namespace for pages about animals, a namespace for pages about plants, and a namespace for pages about people.</p>
<p>To create a namespace, you need to add a <code>&#x3C;namespace></code> tag to the page. The <code>&#x3C;namespace></code> tag has one attribute: <code>name</code>. The <code>name</code> attribute specifies the name of the namespace.</p>
<p>For example, the following code would create a namespace with the name “Animals”:</p>
<pre is:raw="" class="astro-code one-dark-pro" style="background-color: #282c34; overflow-x: auto; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="color: #abb2bf">&#x3C;namespace name="Animals"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #abb2bf">&#x3C;/namespace></span></span></code></pre>
<p>Once you have created a namespace, you can add pages to the namespace by prefixing the page name with the namespace name. For example, the following code would add a page named “Dog” to the “Animals” namespace:</p>
<pre is:raw="" class="astro-code one-dark-pro" style="background-color: #282c34; overflow-x: auto; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="color: #abb2bf">&#x3C;page name="Animals:Dog"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #abb2bf">  {{content}}</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color: #abb2bf">&#x3C;/page></span></span></code></pre>
<p>Tabs and namespaces can be used together to create a more organized and user-friendly wiki. For example, you could create a tab for each namespace, and then use the tabs to navigate to different collections of pages.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for working with tabs and namespaces in MediaWiki:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use tabs to create multiple views of the same page</strong>. This can be helpful for pages that have a lot of content, or for pages that you want to organize into different sections.</li>
<li><strong>Use namespaces to create separate collections of pages</strong>. This can be helpful for pages that are about different topics, or for pages that you want to keep separate for security or privacy reasons.</li>
<li><strong>Use both tabs and namespaces to create a more organized and user-friendly wiki</strong>. This can make it easier for users to find the information that they are looking for.</li>

<p>MediaWiki extensions are software modules that can be added to MediaWiki to add new features or improve existing ones. Extensions can be written in any programming language that supports PHP, and there are thousands of extensions available for MediaWiki.</p>
<p>Extensions can be a great way to enhance the functionality of your MediaWiki installation. Here are a few examples of how extensions can be used to enhance the functionality of MediaWiki:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add new features:</strong> Extensions can be used to add new features to MediaWiki, such as the ability to create tables, upload files, or add citations to your pages.</li>

<p>If you are looking to enhance the functionality of your MediaWiki installation, I recommend checking out the MediaWiki Extension Registry. The MediaWiki Extension Registry is a website that lists all of the available extensions for MediaWiki. You can search the registry by feature, category, or popularity.</p>
<p>Once you have found an extension that you are interested in, you can download it and install it on your MediaWiki installation. The instructions for installing extensions are usually included in the extension’s documentation.</p>
<p>If you have any problems installing or configuring an extension, you can visit the MediaWiki Extension Registry or the MediaWiki documentation for help.</p>
<p>Here are some additional tips for using extensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Only install extensions from trusted sources.</strong> There are many extensions available for MediaWiki, but not all of them are created equal. Some extensions may contain malicious code that could harm your MediaWiki installation.</li>
<li><strong>Read the extension’s documentation carefully.</strong> The extension’s documentation will tell you how to install, configure, and use the extension.</li>
<li><strong>Test the extension thoroughly.</strong> Once you have installed and configured the extension, you need to test it thoroughly to make sure that it works correctly. This can be done by creating a new page and using the extension’s features.</li>
<li><strong>Report any problems to the extension’s author.</strong> If you have any problems installing or configuring an extension, you can report the problem to the extension’s author. The author may be able to help you solve the problem.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>User account verification</strong></p>
<p>User account verification requires users to provide additional information, such as a phone number or email address, when they create an account. This information can then be used to verify the user’s identity and prevent unauthorized access.</p>
<p>There are a number of different ways to implement user account verification. One common way is to use a CAPTCHA. CAPTCHAs are tests that are designed to distinguish between humans and computers. CAPTCHAs can be used to prevent spam bots from creating accounts.</p>
<p>Another common way to implement user account verification is to use a two-factor authentication (2FA) system. 2FA requires users to provide two pieces of information to verify their identity, such as a password and a code from their phone. 2FA can be more secure than CAPTCHAs, but it can also be more inconvenient for users.</p>
<p><strong>Email confirmation</strong></p>
<p>Email confirmation requires users to verify their email address before they can create an account. This can help to prevent spam bots from creating accounts.</p>
<p>There are a number of different ways to implement email confirmation. One common way is to send users an email with a link that they must click to verify their email address. Another common way is to send users a code that they must enter into the wiki’s registration form.</p>
<p>By implementing user account verification and email confirmation, you can help to protect your wiki from spam and vandalism.</p>
<p>Here are some additional tips for implementing user account verification and email confirmation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be proactive:</strong> Don’t wait for problems to happen. Take steps to prevent them from happening in the first place.</li>
<li><strong>Be patient:</strong> Implementing user account verification and email confirmation can be time-consuming. Be patient and don’t give up.</li>
<li><strong>Be persistent:</strong> Spammers and abusers are persistent. Be persistent in your efforts to deal with them.</li>
<li><strong>Be cooperative:</strong> Work with other wiki users to implement user account verification and email confirmation.</li>
<li><strong>Be positive:</strong> Don’t let spam and abuse get you down. Stay positive and keep working to make your wiki a great place.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="79-enabling-social-login-and-authentication-options">7.9 Enabling social login and authentication options</h2>
<p><strong>Enabling Social Login</strong></p>
<p>Social login is a feature that allows users to log in to your wiki using their social media accounts. This can make it easier for users to log in, and it can also help to improve security by reducing the number of passwords that users have to remember.</p>
<p>To enable social login, you will need to create a social login provider. There are a number of different social login providers available, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google:</strong> Google is a popular social login provider that is easy to use.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook:</strong> Facebook is another popular social login provider.</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> LinkedIn is a social login provider that is designed for businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have chosen a social login provider, you will need to configure your wiki to use it. The configuration process will vary depending on the provider that you have chosen. However, there are some general steps that you will need to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Generate a social login key and secret:</strong> You will need to generate a social login key and secret from the social login provider.</li>
<li><strong>Configure your wiki to use the social login key and secret:</strong> You will need to configure your wiki to use the social login key and secret. This will involve providing the social login provider with the URL of your wiki.</li>
</ol>

<p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process in which a user is only granted access to a website or application after successfully presenting two pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism — typically something they know (e.g., a password) and something they have (e.g., a security token).</p>
<p>2FA adds an extra layer of security to your wiki by requiring users to provide a code from their phone in addition to their password. This makes it much more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access to your wiki, even if they have your password.</p>
<p>There are a number of different 2FA providers that you can use. Some of the most popular providers include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Authenticator:</strong> Google Authenticator is a free 2FA app that is easy to use.</li>
<li><strong>Authy:</strong> Authy is a free 2FA app that is designed to be more secure than Google Authenticator.</li>
<li><strong>Duo Security:</strong> Duo Security is a paid 2FA service that offers a number of features that are not available in free 2FA apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have chosen a 2FA provider, you will need to configure your wiki to use it. The configuration process will vary depending on the provider that you have chosen. However, there are some general steps that you will need to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Generate a 2FA key:</strong> You will need to generate a 2FA key from the 2FA provider.</li>

<h2 id="818-collaborative-editing-and-simultaneous-editing-features">8.18 Collaborative editing and simultaneous editing features</h2>
<p>Collaborative editing is the ability for multiple users to edit a document at the same time. This can be a great way to work on projects together, as it allows users to share ideas and feedback in real time.</p>
<p>There are a number of different ways to implement collaborative editing. One common approach is to use a wiki. Wikis are websites that allow users to create and edit pages without having to know any special coding. This makes them ideal for collaborative editing, as they are easy to use and can be accessed from anywhere.</p>
<p>Another common approach to collaborative editing is to use a document collaboration tool. Document collaboration tools allow users to share and edit documents in real time. These tools typically offer a number of features that make collaborative editing easier, such as version control and conflict resolution.</p>
<p>Which approach you choose for collaborative editing will depend on your specific needs. If you need a simple way for users to share and edit documents, a wiki may be a good option. If you need a more robust tool with features like version control and conflict resolution, a document collaboration tool may be a better choice.</p>
<p>Here are some of the benefits of collaborative editing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased productivity:</strong> Collaborative editing can help to increase productivity by allowing users to work on projects together in real time. This can save time and effort, as users do not have to wait for each other to finish their work before they can continue.</li>
<li><strong>Improved communication:</strong> Collaborative editing can help to improve communication by allowing users to share ideas and feedback in real time. This can help to prevent misunderstandings and ensure that everyone is on the same page.</li>
<li><strong>Better decision-making:</strong> Collaborative editing can help to improve decision-making by allowing users to share their thoughts and ideas. This can help to ensure that all perspectives are considered and that the best decision is made.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some of the challenges of collaborative editing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conflict resolution:</strong> One of the biggest challenges of collaborative editing is conflict resolution. When multiple users are editing a document, it is possible that they will make changes that conflict with each other. This can be a challenge to resolve, as it requires users to agree on which changes should be kept.</li>
<li><strong>Version control:</strong> Another challenge of collaborative editing is version control. When multiple users are editing a document, it is important to be able to track changes and revert to previous versions if necessary. This can be a challenge to manage, as it requires users to be careful about which changes they make and to keep track of which version of the document is the most recent.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Collaborative editing can also pose security challenges. When multiple users have access to a document, it is important to make sure that the document is protected from unauthorized access. This can be a challenge to manage, as it requires users to be careful about who they share the document with.</li>
