<h2 id="larry-page-and-sergey-brin-meet-at-stanford-university">Larry Page and Sergey Brin meet at Stanford University.</h2>
<p>Larry Page and Sergey Brin met at Stanford University in 1995, as both were in the school’s computer science graduate program. Page was a Ph.D. student, while Brin was a master’s student. The two men were assigned to work together on a project, and they quickly bonded over their shared interests in computer science and the Internet.</p>
<p>In the course of their work, Page and Brin developed a new algorithm for ranking web pages. This algorithm, which they called PageRank, was based on the idea that the importance of a web page is determined by the number and quality of links to that page. PageRank was a significant improvement over the existing methods for ranking web pages, and it quickly made Google the most popular search engine in the world.</p>
<p>In 1998, Page and Brin left Stanford to start Google full-time. The company quickly grew, and it went public in 2004. Today, Google is one of the most valuable companies in the world, and it has had a profound impact on the way we live and work.</p>
<p>The meeting of Larry Page and Sergey Brin at Stanford University was a pivotal moment in the history of the Internet. The two men’s shared vision and their passion for technology led to the creation of Google, which has changed the world in countless ways.</p>
<h2 id="they-develop-the-pagerank-algorithm">They develop the PageRank algorithm.</h2>
<p>Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed the PageRank algorithm in 1996 as part of their research project at Stanford University. The algorithm is based on the idea that the importance of a web page is determined by the number and quality of links to that page. A page with more links from other high-quality pages is considered to be more important than a page with fewer links from lower-quality pages.</p>
<p>The PageRank algorithm is used by Google to rank web pages in its search results. It is one of the most important factors that determines the order of the results, and it is responsible for making Google the most popular search engine in the world.</p>
<p>The PageRank algorithm is a complex mathematical formula, but the basic idea is quite simple. The algorithm starts by assigning a rank of 1 to every web page. Then, it calculates the rank of each page by looking at the links that point to it. A page with more links from other high-quality pages will have a higher rank than a page with fewer links from lower-quality pages.</p>
<p>The PageRank algorithm is constantly updated as new web pages are created and links are added. This ensures that the search results are always up-to-date and accurate.</p>
<p>The PageRank algorithm is a brilliant piece of work, and it has had a profound impact on the way we use the Internet. It is one of the most important factors that has made Google the success that it is today.</p>
<h2 id="they-launch-google-in-1998">They launch Google in 1998.</h2>

<h2 id="a-more-detailed-description-of-how-larry-page-and-sergey-brin-developed-the-pagerank-algorithm">A more detailed description of how Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed the PageRank algorithm.</h2>
<p>Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed the PageRank algorithm as part of their doctoral dissertations at Stanford University. The algorithm is based on the idea that the importance of a web page can be determined by the number and quality of links to that page. Pages that are linked to by many other pages are considered to be more important than pages that are linked to by few pages.</p>
<p>The PageRank algorithm works by assigning a score to each web page, called its PageRank. The PageRank of a page is calculated by taking into account the PageRank of the pages that link to it. The more PageRank a page has, the more likely it is to be linked to by other pages.</p>
<p>The PageRank algorithm is a recursive algorithm, which means that it is calculated in a series of steps. In the first step, the PageRank of each page is set to 1. In the next step, the PageRank of each page is updated by adding the PageRank of the pages that link to it. This process is repeated until the PageRank of all pages converges, which means that it no longer changes.</p>
<p>The PageRank algorithm has been very successful in ranking web pages. It is the main algorithm used by Google to rank web pages in its search results. The PageRank algorithm has also been used by other search engines, such as Bing and Yahoo.</p>
<p>The PageRank algorithm has been criticized for being susceptible to manipulation.
